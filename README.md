Course 3 - Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights

Your team is still in the early stages of their user churn project. So far, you’ve completed a project proposal and used Python to inspect and organize Waze’s user data.

You check your inbox and notice a new message from Chidi Ga, your team’s Senior Data Analyst. Chidi is pleased with the work you have already completed and requests your assistance with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and further data visualization. Harriet Hadzic, Waze's Director of Data Analysis, will want to review a Python notebook that shows your data exploration and visualization.

A notebook was structured and prepared to help you in this project. Please complete the following questions and prepare an executive summary.
